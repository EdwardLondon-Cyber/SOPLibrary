//|Clean Source Principle| The practice of requiring all security dependencies to be as trustworthy as the object being secured. Per Microsoft, "any subject in control of an object is a security dependency of that object. If an adversary can control anything in control of a target object, they can control that target object. Because of this threat, you must ensure that the assurances for all security dependencies are at or above the desired security level of the object itself." (Microsoft)
//|Cloud Consumer| A person or organization that maintains a business relationship with and uses service from one or more cloud provider. (NIST)

//|Community Cloud| Cloud infrastructure that is provisioned for exclusive use by a specific community of cloud consumers from organizations that have shared concerns (e.g., mission, security requirements, policy, and compliance considerations). A community cloud may be owned, managed, and operated by one or more of the organizations in the community, a third party, or some combination of them, and it may exist on or off premises.
//|Computing Systems| Computing systems are defined as desktop devices, laptop devices, mobile devices, tablet devices, servers, and Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) systems. Computing systems are a subset of information systems and may be physical or virtual.

//## E
//|Elevated Privilege| Having the ability to change the system configuration of a compute system.
//|Email Server| A server that has the ability to send and receive email for remote clients. A system that only handles self-generated email is not an email server.
