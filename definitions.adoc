|Term|Definition
//## A
//|AA Account|A type of Active Directory Resource Management Account; specifically, an administrator account. The standard method of performing administrative functions at NASA is through the use of NASA Consolidated Active Directory (NCAD) administrative accounts. These accounts have the prefix "aa-" (e.g., aa-jdoe).
//|Authentication| Verifying the identity of a user, process, or device, often as a prerequisite to allowing access to resources in an information system. (NIST)
//|Authorization|Access privileges granted to a user, program, or process or the act of granting those privileges. (NIST)


//## B
//|Block Storage| An approach to data storage in which data is broken down into blocks that are stored separately. Each block has a unique identifier within the storage system. Also know as "block-level storage".
