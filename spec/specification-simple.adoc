DOCUMENT HISTORY LOG:
  Newest version in the top row! 
  Oldest/first version in the bottom row!

  You must *add a row to the top of the table* each time a new version of the Spec is published.
 
  Track drafts and include descriptions for each draft while the document is out for review. 

  But be sure to DELETE DRAFT TRACKING and update the approved date when it is signed and ready to be published. 

  The description box must not be left blank, but it should be brief. 
   Example descriptions: "Updated to be applicable to xyz"

   NOTE: 
    Approval Date: this will automatically be pulled from the COVER PAGE VARIABLES.

    If you are writing an updated version of a Spec, the approval date must be hard coded for the earlier version(s), and the Approval Date variable must be used only for the most recent version.

FOREWORD:
 Note that this template is worded to best suit Specs that fall under Standard 2601.

 If your spec does not fall under Standard 2601 - make sure to edit paragraph 3 so that it is accurate for your spec. 
////

== Foreword

This NASA Technical Specification is published by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to describe technical requirements for purchased or in-house items, services, functions, or processes for NASA programs and projects.

This NASA Technical Specification is approved for use by NASA Headquarters and NASA Centers and Facilities, and applicable technical requirements may be cited in contract, program, and other Agency documents. This Specification also applies to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) (a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC)), other contractors, recipients of grants and cooperative agreements, and parties to other agreements only to the extent specified or referenced in applicable contracts, grants, or agreements.

Adherence to this NASA Technical Specification ensures compliance with NASA-STD-2601, _Minimum Cybersecurity Requirements for Computing Systems_, which defines operating system and application security requirements that must be implemented on NASA information systems. This Specification provides the enforceable, measurable details of NASA-STD-2601.

Requests for information, corrections, or additions to this Specification can be made via the "Contact ASCS" form, found here: https://cset.nasa.gov/ascs/requests/.

NUMBERED SECTIONS:
  This is the point at which document numbering begins.
  
  Please be sure to read comment blocks for instructions. 
////

:numbered:

////
SCOPE:
 The name of the OS or App will be automatically input as long as you have properly filled in the Document Variables section at the top of this Spec. 

 If your Spec is not a configuration Spec, you may also need to rewrite the Purpose and Applicability sections to fit your Spec. - Please read the comment blocks above each subheading. 
////

== Scope

////
Purpose: 
 If your spec does not fall under Standard 2601/ is not a configuration Spec:
   Make sure to edit the Purpose so that it is accurate for your spec. 
    "define" is probably the best verb for Specification purpose statements. (establish = for standards; provide guidance = for handbooks)
////

=== Purpose

The purpose of this NASA Technical Specification is to define version and configuration requirements for {application} deployment and operation.

////
Applicability: 
 There are two options for sentence 1 under Applicability - choose the one that applies to your spec to make visible. 
     e.g.:
       SEP is applicable to all computing systems = choose first option.
       An Adobe spec would only be applicable to systems that have Adobe.  = choose second option. 
 
 If your spec does not fall under Standard 2601/ is not a configuration Spec:
   Make sure to edit paragraph 1 under Applicability so that it is accurate for your spec. 
////
=== Applicability

ifeval::[ "{applicability}" == "all" ]
This NASA Technical Specification is applicable to all computing systems.
endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{applicability}" != "all" ]
This NASA Technical Specification is applicable to all computing systems using {application}. 
endif::[]

This NASA Technical Specification is approved for use by NASA Headquarters and NASA Centers and Facilities, and applicable technical requirements may be cited in contract, program, and other Agency documents. It also applies to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC)), other contractors, recipients of grants and cooperative agreements, and parties to other agreements only to the extent specified or referenced in applicable contracts, grants, or agreements.

=== Tailoring

In accordance with NASA-STD-2601, _Minimum Cybersecurity Requirements for Computing Systems_, any and all risk-based decisions (RBDs) to tailor this NASA Technical Specification in order to meet the needs of a specific program, project, or system *_SHALL_* be approved by the responsible Information System Owner (ISO) and Authorizing Official (AO) and formally documented by the ISO or system administrators in the  System Security Plan (SSP) under program or project requirements. 

NASA-STD-2601 mandates that the AO *_SHALL_* ensure that only systems posing an acceptable level of risk to Agency assets, data, and personnel are approved for production operation and that the ISO *_SHALL_* ensure all necessary documentation is produced and maintained. 

Document tailoring of the requirements in this NASA Technical Specification for application to a specific program or project as part of program or project requirements and obtain formal approval by the delegated Technical Authority in accordance with NPR 7120.5__x__, _NASA Space Flight Program and Project Management Requirements_.

Note that some NASA Technical Specifications include configuration settings that are classified as "critical". Settings that are classified as "critical" *_SHALL NOT_* be eligible for any modifications through the application of an RBD.

=== Authority

The Agency Chief Information Officer (CIO) and Senior Agency Information Security Officer (SAISO) have authorized the Cybersecurity Standards and Engineering Team (CSET) via the Agency Security Configuration Standards (ASCS) initiative to create binding Technical Standards related to Agency cybersecurity topics.

The NASA Technical Standards Program (NTSP), sponsored by the Office of the NASA Chief Engineer, recognizes CSET as a standards-developing organization within the Agency. NTSP provides access to all technical standards at: https://standards.nasa.gov/.

APPENDIX SECTION
 Note:
   Appendix is commented out - move the comment block if applicable. 

  Appendices are numbered differently then the rest of the document, so make sure to use 3 or more markers on subsection
    titles (=== SUBSECTION). If you drop to 2 markers (==) it will start normal numbering again.
  Content of the appendix will format for sections and subsections, but not number them.
  
  It is appropriate to continue using heading tags (===) as normal.
  
  Appendices will be lettered based on the [appendix] tag, so the example title will appear as
   APPENDIX A: TITLE OF APPENDIX

  Additional appendices can be used by the [appendix] tag immediately followed on the next line with a
    2 marker title (== APPENDIX TITLE). following appendix will use appropriate letters (B, C, D...)
