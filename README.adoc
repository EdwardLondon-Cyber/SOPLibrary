= Document Basecamp

This repository houses the AsciiDoc templates and styles utilized to create CSET's Standards, Handbook, Specifications.

== Templates
The following subsections provide directions on where to find each of CSET's document template directories, the contents of those directories, and instructions on how to use the files contained in those directories. 

The files contained in each of these directories serve as the format to be used for creating each kind of CSET document. 

=== CSET Handbooks
CSET's Handbook template directory is located in the following location: https://developer.nasa.gov/CSET/document_basecamp/tree/master/hdbk

*This directory contains the following three files:*

* handbook.adoc
* hbk-pdf-cover.adoc
* hdbk-document-variables.adoc

WARNING: Do not rename these files. Files reference each other by name.

2. Add Document Basecamp as a submodule within your Handbook. (See Section 2.1., _Add Document Basecamp with Git Submodule_ for instructions.)

3. From the Document Basecamp folder in your Handbook's directory, *make a copy of the following files and paste them into your Handbook's main directory*: 

 * handbook.adoc
 * hbk-pdf-cover.adoc
 * hdbk-document-variables.adoc

4. Input or edit the variables in your Handbook's copy of the *hdbk-document-variables.adoc* file first. 
 * The variables in this document will be used throughout the Handbook and the cover page. 
5. Then write or update your Handbook's copy of the *handbook.adoc* file - this is where the main contents of your Spec will be contained. 

*Note:* You do not need to edit the *hbk-pdf-cover.adoc* file, but this file does need to be included for the pdf version of your Handbook to be properly generated.

== Git Workflow

=== Add Document Basecamp with Git Submodule to a New Repository

You can add Document Basecamp to a document tree by using the git submodule command:

[source]
----
git submodule add https://developer.nasa.gov/CSET/document_basecamp.git
git add .
git commit -m "adding document_basecamp to document"
git push origin <branch name>
----

The document_basecamp directory will be added as a submodule in the repository. 

=== Initializing Document Basecamp in an Existing Repository

Use these commands if you have cloned an existing repository and you need to get the document basecamp contents into the submodule: 

[source]
----
git submodule init
git submodule update
----

=== Updating Document Basecamp

If you are working in a repository that contains an outdated version of the document_basecamp submodule, use these commands to get the most up-to-date version: 

[source]
----
cd document_basecamp
git fetch
git merge -s recursive -Xours origin origin/master
----
